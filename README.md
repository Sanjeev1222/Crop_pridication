## 📌 Overview

The **Crop Prediction Model** is a Machine Learning-based system that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions.

It helps farmers and agricultural planners make data-driven decisions to improve productivity and reduce crop failure risk.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers often struggle to choose the right crop due to changing weather and soil conditions.  
This project uses ML algorithms to analyze agricultural data and predict the best crop scientifically.

---

## 🧠 Features

✔️ Predicts crop using soil & weather parameters  
✔️ High accuracy ML model  
✔️ Clean and structured dataset  
✔️ Easy-to-use input system  
✔️ Scalable for web deployment  

---

## 📊 Input Parameters

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- pH Value
- Rainfall (mm)
